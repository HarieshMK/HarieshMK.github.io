# About the Club: Why I’m Here

### The Day My Perspective Shifted
A few years ago, a senior colleague named Perumal Sir asked me a question out of nowhere that changed my life: **"What’s your bank balance right now?"**

I told him maybe 35,000 to 40,000 rupees. He asked another colleague the same question. That colleague, who earned much more than me, replied: *"Sir, I have 600 rupees left."* It was only four days after salary day.

Perumal Sir looked at me and asked: *"You’ve been working here for six months. You’ve earned nearly 1.5 Lakhs. Where is the rest of it?"*

I stood there in silence for two minutes. He recommended I list every bank statement from my first day of work to see exactly where my money went.

### The 40% Trap
That night, I skipped dinner and opened my bank statements. I did the math:
* **20%** went to rent.
* **20%** went to food.
* **40% went to "nothing."** Tea, snacks, pastries, movies, and useless stuff I couldn't even remember buying. 

I wasn't living a luxury life; I was just **leaking money.** I asked parents and friends for help, but everyone gave me the same "safe" answers: FDs, RDs, and LIC schemes. No one could explain *how* to actually build wealth.

### The "Market Risk" Wall
When I turned to YouTube, every video ended with the same fast-talking disclaimer: *"Mutual funds are subject to market risks."* To a clueless beginner, "Risk" sounded like: **"You will lose everything."**

I was too scared to touch Mutual Funds. I did the only thing I understood: I opened two RDs and one PPF.

**The 60% Revelation:** Once I stopped the 40% leak, I was saving 60% of my salary every month. My life didn't change a "teeny bit." I was still doing everything I loved; I just stopped spending on things I didn't actually care about.

### The Reality of the "YOLO" Trend
I’ll be honest: seeing friends on exotic vacations made me feel like I was failing. But I eventually realized there are two different paths:

1.  **The Income Gap:** Some people earn in multiples of what I do. They can afford that lifestyle.
2.  **The Debt Trap:** Many others fund that "dream life" through personal loans, mortgaging their peace of mind for a temporary trip.

I realized if I tried to "YOLO" like the high-earners, I would end up like the debt-takers. I had to learn to live **my** life, based on **my** math.

### Why This Blog Exists
I’ve always loved teaching. I used to teach my friends the night before exams in college. **The Unexciting Money Club is how I finally become that teacher.**

> **Why a blog and not just YouTube?**
> Making one quality video takes me almost an entire week. In contrast, writing a blog post takes me only 30 minutes. This blog allows me to share thoughts the moment they happen and be much more active in helping you.

#### This website is for:
* **The Strategic Planner:** The person who wants to buy a car with a massive downpayment because they planned for it (those early RDs I started actually became the downpayment for my first car!).
* **The "Leak" Fixer:** The person who wants to stop the silent drain on their bank account.
* **The Student:** The person who wants to understand *why* they are investing, not just where.

I want to be your "Perumal Sir"—the person who ignites the spark and helps you realize that building wealth doesn't have to be exciting. It just has to be consistent.

**Join the club. Let’s make your money unexcitingly reliable.**
