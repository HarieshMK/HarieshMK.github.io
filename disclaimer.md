# The Reality Check

Before we get into the numbers, we need to be clear about what this club is—and what it isn't.

### 1. I am not your guru.
I am a student of finance, just like you. The thoughts shared on this website are based on my personal research and journey. They are not professional financial, investment, or tax advice. I don’t know your salary, your debts, or your risk tolerance—so I cannot tell you what to do with your money.

### 2. The Tip of the Iceberg
Mastering your finances isn't about reading one blog post and getting rich. What you see here is barely the surface. Real wealth is built through **discipline, time, and constant learning.** ### 3. Take it slow
Finance can be overwhelming. Please be patient with the process and, more importantly, be patient with yourself. My goal is to reduce the "noise," but the final decisions are—and always should be—yours.

*Always consult with a certified professional before making major financial moves.*
